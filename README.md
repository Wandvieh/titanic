# Titantic Dataset

[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Final results

Will be posted here as soon as I have them

## My To Do List
Models
- Logistic Regression
- Poisson Regression
- LDA
- QDA

Extensions
- interaction terms (e.g. between the Cabin Letters and their numbers - but there are so many missing entries that it probably won't be important)
- polynomial methods

Validations
- bootstrap
- 5fold / 10fold CV

Other considerations
- does the data have a gaussian distribution? -> if not, logistic regression will work better than LDA
- do the variables have a common covariance matrix? -> if not, logistic regression will work better than LDA
